  description: "Statistical analysis and forecasting World Model for time series data"

  # --- Time Series Analysis Configuration ---
  time_series:
    # Number of historical data points for analysis. Larger windows capture more
    # stable patterns but are slower.
    window_size: 100
    
    # Forecast horizon in minutes. Shorter horizons are more accurate.
    forecast_horizon: 60
    
    # Statistical confidence interval for predictions (e.g., 0.95 for 95%).
    confidence_interval: 0.95

  # --- Anomaly Detection Configuration ---
  anomaly_detection:
    # "isolation_forest": Good general-purpose algorithm.
    # "one_class_svm": Effective for high-dimensional data.
    # "local_outlier_factor": Good for density-based anomalies.
    method: "isolation_forest"
    
    # Expected proportion of anomalies in the dataset (0.0 to 1.0).
    # Lower values make detection more sensitive.
    contamination: 0.1

  # --- Forecasting Models and Ensemble Configuration ---
  forecasting:
    # Multiple models can be used to improve accuracy.
    models:
      - "arima"
      - "exponential_smoothing"
      - "linear_regression"
    
    # Method for combining multiple model predictions.
    # "average" is robust, "weighted" is based on historical accuracy.
    ensemble_method: "average"

  # --- Model Performance Evaluation Metrics ---
  # Used to evaluate and compare forecasting models. Lower values are better.
  metrics:
    - "mse"   # Mean Squared Error
    - "mae"   # Mean Absolute Error
    - "mape"  # Mean Absolute Percentage Error
