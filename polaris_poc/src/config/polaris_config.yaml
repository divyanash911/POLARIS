# POLARIS framework configuration
# Keys here are flattened to environment variables by the ConfigurationManager
# (e.g. logger.name -> LOGGER_NAME). Keep only framework-level configurable
# settings. System/plugin-specific settings belong in the plugin `config.yaml`.

nats:
  url: "nats://localhost:4222"  # NATS server URL used by adapters (default)

telemetry:
  # Subject for streaming individual telemetry events (MonitorAdapter.publish)
  stream_subject: "polaris.telemetry.events.stream"
  # Subject for batched telemetry events (MonitorAdapter.batch publish)
  batch_subject: "polaris.telemetry.events.batch"
  # Maximum number of events per batch (send when reached)
  batch_size: 100
  # Maximum wait (seconds) before sending an incomplete batch
  batch_max_wait: 1.0
  # Max queue size used by MonitorAdapter for in-memory buffering (0 = unbounded)
  queue_maxsize: 5000
  # If true, publish individual events immediately in addition to batching
  stream: true

execution:
  # NATS subject where control actions are expected (ExecutionAdapter listens)
  # Default used by code is 'polaris.execution.actions' if omitted.
  action_subject: "polaris.execution.actions"
  # Subject where execution results are published (ExecutionAdapter uses this)
  result_subject: "polaris.execution.results"
  # Subject used to publish execution-related metrics
  metrics_subject: "polaris.execution.metrics"

logger:
  # Logger name used by the framework (becomes LOGGER_NAME env var)
  name: "polaris"
  # Logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  level: "DEBUG"
  # Format for logs: 'pretty' for colored human output, 'json' for structured logs
  format: "pretty"
