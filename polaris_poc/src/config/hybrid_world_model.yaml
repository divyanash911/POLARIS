  # --- Model Weight Configuration ---
  # Weights determine each model's contribution. Must sum to 1.0.
  model_weights:
    gemini: 0.6
    statistical: 0.3
    mock: 0.1

  # --- Fallback Strategy Configuration ---
  # Order of models to try when primary models fail.
  fallback_order:
    - "gemini"
    - "statistical"
    - "mock"

  # --- Confidence Level Thresholds ---
  # Define confidence categories for decision making.
  confidence_thresholds:
    high: 0.8
    medium: 0.6
    low: 0.4

  # --- Consensus and Agreement Configuration ---
  # Controls how multiple models must agree before accepting a decision.
  consensus:
    # Minimum number of models that must provide a response.
    min_models: 2
    
    # Minimum agreement level between models (0.0 to 1.0).
    agreement_threshold: 0.7
